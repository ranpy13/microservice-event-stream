# Account Microservice: Worker

The `account-worker` module is a event stream processing application that listens for `Account` domain events as AMQP messages. The domain events that are generated by the `account-web` application are processed in this module. The worker is responsible for durable transaction processing for work flows that are required to coordinate asynchronously with applications residing in other domain contexts. The worker is also responsible for automatically remediating state changes in a distributed transactions that encountered a partial failure. The most important goal of the worker module is to keep the state of the system consistent through automated means â€” to guarantee eventual consistency.
